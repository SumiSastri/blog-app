        <h2>Prema's story</h2>

<p>From a liberal family of Tamil writers, Prema was inspired by her paternal great-grand uncle, Pandit Natesa Sastri (1859-1906), who translated great works of Tamil literature into English in the 19th century.

She also admired her maternal great-grand uncle, Angarai T Sadasivam Iyer (1902-1997), who married the music doyen, MS Subalakshmi. Also known as Kalki Sadasivam Iyer, he was a freedom fighter, co-founder of the Tamil magazine <em>Kalki</em> and a well-known film producer and script writer.</p>

<h2>Early years 1930s-1940s</h2>

<p>Prema developed an interest in the arts & literature from a very early age. When she was seven, her mother gave her a pencil and paper to keep her out of mischief.  Prema wrote poems which her mother collected and tied in a blue ribbon. Her first works were published in the children’s page of the local English newspaper in Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>As a child growing up during the Second World War and the Partition of India, she was deeply impacted by the suffering and cruelty she witnessed and stopped writing poetry when the family moved from Tamil Nadu to West Bengal.

Her father, Angari Viswanathan Iyer (V.N. Rajan), was a British Civil Servant, when a nascent India was being formed. Her mother Jaya  Lakshmi, was an active social worker, socialite and actress showing great fortitude in tough times.

The family moved from Dharapuram, Coimbatore where she was born, to Madras (Chennai).</p> 

<p>Her initial memory of the Second World War, when it broke out, was of great joy as all the children at <em>Church Park Convent</em> were given the day off and asked to go home. It was only later, when her father was posted to West Bengal, that she understood the gravity of the situation.

</p><p>In the run up to the Partition of India, the family narrowly escaped being slaughtered on two different occasions. Prema, and her sister Hima, were sent to a British private school, <em>Dow Hill</em> in Keursong, Darjeeling.

</p> <p>Prema lived in Calcutta continuing her education at <em>Loretto Convent</em>. Witnessing famine in Bengal, while the family lived in the lap of luxury, left a life-long scar. Prema was always concerned that guests who came to her house were well fed and was troubled by life’s great contradictions.

</p> 

<p>In the twilight years of the British Raj,  Prema wrote her Senior Cambridge exams coming first in the Commonwealth for English. She answered only one question, and expected to fail. </p> <p>The question she answered was which of Shakespeare's characters was the most intriguing and why. Prema chose Cassius, from Shakespeare's <em>Julius Ceasar</em>, arguing that he was one true to his beliefs. Unlike Brutus, he stood for what he believed in and did not betray his convictions.</p>

<h2>A passion for writing 1950s to 2000</h2>

<p>Her father was now posted back to the south of India.  Prema continued her studies in Queen Mary’s College, Madras and completed her first degree in Economics as one of the few women who attended the course in Government Arts College, Coimbatore.

In her final year of college, she won a scholarship to study in the United States.

She completed a second degree in Liberal Arts at Chatham College, Pittsburgh. Witnessing the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s in the United States she was hesitant to remain there even though she was engaged to an American professor.

On her return to India, Prema was swept away by the enthusiasm the newly formed Indian Republic.  She decided not to return to the United States and married an Indian army officer.

</p>

<p>As an army wife, Prema continued to write, typing furiously through the night on her portable Remington – one of her remaining treasures from her days in the United States.She soon established herself as a leading Indian writer in English and was consistently listed as one of the top 100 prominent short-fiction writers in India through the Sixties.

In the early Seventies, her interest in the theatre grew and she staged her first play, Shivaji, which she wrote, directed and produced. She was presented with a national award for her work as a pioneering theatre professional who combined her love for Indian history with the arts.

She continued to write short fiction and historical dramas in the Eighties when her three children had all left home.

In the Nineties, as an empty nester,  Prema continued writing and directing short-plays but developed a distinct interest in communications and business studies. She studied once again – a Masters in Business Administration starting up her own coaching academy.  She used her interest in theatre developing role playing  scenarios for leadership coaching. A young Rahul Dravid, the former Indian cricket captain, was one of her early mentees.</p>

<h2>Late years 2000 to 2017</h2>

<p>When her husband passed away in the year 2000,  Prema gave up writing, coaching and spent a significant amount of time with local charitable trusts and foundations.

It was only in the mid-to-late 2000’s that she recovered her joie de vivre and launched Songbyrde Publishing.  Her mission? To publish the work of other writers.

She became an active member of a local book club and writers group, encouraging new voices to grow and establish their work as a collective.  Prema, discovered the internet and blogging, writing short blog posts on how to write fiction, plays and non-fiction, she also started a Facebook page where she launched her final collection of short stories – Butterfly Dreams – when she turned 80!

In July 2017, after several minor falls and a major hip-replacement, Prema was bed-ridden and left her friends and family.  Acutely aware that there was a shortage of bodies for young medical students, Prema, who was no believer of rites and rituals requested that her mortal remains were to be donated to St. John’s hospital for young students to practice surgery.</p>

<h2>Literary Legacy</h2>
<p>Prema may have stopped writing but her legacy as a pioneer of Indian writing in English, especially in the genre of short-story writing and plays lives on as does her call Indian writers in English: “You are unique and have something to give the world. Keep writing.”</p>
