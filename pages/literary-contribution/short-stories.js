<p>“We are heroic, cowardly, hurt, passionate, kind or cruel at different moments.We know very little about ourselves, and still less about others. We shout at the clerk behind the counter, not knowing he has recently lost a child. We imagine we can do the impossible and end up living with unfulfilled dreams. I describe people caught in diffiucult situations and the manner in which they have reacted. My stories are about insights and perceptions rather than high drama. They are about people we have met without knowing the rich complexity of their lives.”
