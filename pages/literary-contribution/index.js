        <h2>Prema Sastri's contribution to the diaspora of Indian authors writing in English</h2>
        <p>Writing since the early 1950s, Prema Sastri was a pioneering Indian author writing in English. Following in the footsteps of RK Narayan, Prema's contribution to the Indian literary world was as a short-story writer. Inspired by Earnest Hemingway, her style is crisp and lacks figurative decoration of metaphors, similies and other literary `vanities`. Her belief was the plot and character should drive the story. </p>
